# sEIGAAboutMeWebsiteProject
GA SEI program admissions project

This project was created for my admissions project for the SEI program offered by General Assembly.  The goal was to create an about me website that uses a custom font, JavaScript, had a picture of me, link to my LinkedIn profile, and an about me section.
